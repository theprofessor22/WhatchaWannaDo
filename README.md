# WhatchaWannaDo is a Nashville night planner with the specific goal of helping users find out what shows are going on and where you can get something to eat, drink, and be merry before or after the show.

WhatchaWannaDo's interface is a Tableau dashboard with the geospatial locations for 7 Nashville music venues and the locations of every restaurant/bar/liquor store within a half mile of each venue and the maximum distance from the venue for all food/drink locations can be adjusted using a slider. There is a calendar that allows the user to change months/dates and thus the events displayed on the map. Hovering the cursor over the venue name will display a tooltip containing the date, event name, the ticket price, and the show time for that venue. Clicking on the venue name will bring up a web browser with the event's ticket seller's website. If non-event locations are hovered over the tooltip displays the name of establishment, address, the Yelp categories it falls under, the distance in miles from the nearest venue, and the Yelp star rating. The Yelp categories are also used to make a wildcard filter, allowing users to enter their preferred criteria to narrow the search
